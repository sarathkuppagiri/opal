# OPAL

OPA (Open Policy Agent) brings the power of decoupled policy to the infrastructure layer (especially K8s), and light applications.
OPAL supercharges OPA to meet the pace of live applications, where the state relevant to authorization decisions may change with every user click and API call.

OPAL builds on top of OPA adding realtime updates (via Websocket Pub/Sub) for both policy and data.

OPAL embraces decoupling of policy and code, and doubles down on decoupling policy (git driven) and data (distributed data-source fetching engines).
